# Open External Editor

## Summary

Godot's script editor is quite good, but if you're coming from Vim or Emacs,
moving around can feel sluggish.

It's already possible to write scripts in an external editor, but there's no way
to quickly switch back to the built-in editor (for, say, debugging) without
opening the editor settings and disabling the external editor.

This plugin gives you the best of both worlds by adding a button to the
top-right of the built-in script editor that opens the current script in your
defined external editor. When you save the script, Godot will detect the change
and automatically reload it.

## Installation

### As submodule

If you use `git` as your Version Control System (VCS), you can You can install
this as a submodule of your project as follows.

```bash
# Godot 3
git submodule add -b gd3 \
    https://github.com/krayon/godot-addon-open-external-editor.git \
    addons/open-external-editor
```

This will check out the Godot 3 branch of the addon as a submodule of your
repository, under your project's `addons/` directory.

For Godot 4 it's the same but a different branch:

```bash
# Godot 4
git submodule add -b gd4 \
    https://github.com/krayon/godot-addon-open-external-editor.git \
    addons/open-external-editor
```

If you ever need to clone again you should do so using either:

```bash
# Clone and then initialise and checkout submodules automatically
git clone --recurse-submodules <YOUR_CLONE_ADDRESS_HERE>
```

or after cloning, manually initialise and checkout the submodule:

```bash
# Initialise and checkout submodules
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
